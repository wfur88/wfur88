- 👋 Hi, I’m @wfur88
- 👀 I’m interested in Leatherworking, sport fencing, bouldering, and a career change. I don't know if this is the route I want to go, but here I am trying to figure it out.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the basics of programming from learnproggramming.online after which I plan to go through learnjavascript.online.  My goal is to learn enough to determine if programming is a viable career option.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on whatever assignments through the above mentioned programs I need help with and potentially future work.
- 📫 To reach me, email is best. wfur@hotmail.com
